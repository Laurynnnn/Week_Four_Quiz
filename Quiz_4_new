#6. Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
# If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
# Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver 
# one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, 
# if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
# If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”
